title: What is GammaSense?
---

If you live near a nuclear power plant, you would like to stay informed on potentially increased radiation levels. At this moment, residents are dependent on institutions and governments for this information. Information about potential hazards or incidents often takes  a long time to reach theas people. What could we do in this context with all the equipment in our home to become better informed?

With a smartphone, laptop or PC with webcam you can measure radiation quite well. When you cover your camera with a piece of aluminum foil, which is  covered with black tape, you can start measuring. Cameras and webcams can thus capture the Gammas radiation and convert them into one unit per minute. This allows large increases to be captured and plotted on a map.

Currently, this experimental platform is in full development. Values ​​that are measured are not absolute. The calibration and sensitivity of different cameras used is currently being looked into. In addition, it is good to know that the measurement tries to bring big differences into the map, as a canary in the coal mine.
