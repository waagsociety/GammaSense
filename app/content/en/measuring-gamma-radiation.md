title: How do I measure gamma radiation?
---

The classic way of measuring nuclear radiation is with a so-called Geiger-Muller tube. In this vacuum tube, small particles collide on ionized gas molecules. The technique around it determines how often per minute that happens. With a webcam it is also possible to count how often per minute particles are seen that collide with the photosensitive part of the camera. In fact, the same size is determined, only the sensitivity of a webcam is much lower compared to traditional measuring equipment. This disadvantage can be overcome by providing many more measurement points, which allows scientists to make statements about the actual radiation. 

The classic situation with a few but reliable datapoints can be expanded, in the case of sufficient density, with many more measurements which can increase the overal reliability.
