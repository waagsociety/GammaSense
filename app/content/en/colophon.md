title: Making Sense & Waag Society
---

Making Sense is a European program that develops methods in community based environmental sensing, through pilots in three cities (Pristina, Barcelona and Amsterdam) to involve citizens in measuring their environment. In collaboration with various official measurement institutes, designers, developers and end users, Making Sense explores open-source tools and experiments in bottom-up citizen science. For more information on these pilots and methods, see the [Making Sense][1] project.

Waag Society, the Dutch partner within Making Sense, is an institute of art, science and technology. Waag Society explores emerging technologies and gives art and culture a decisive role in designing meaningful applications for societal challenges. This is not just in citizen science, but also for example in biotechnology, healthcare and education. [Waag Society][2]

An important part of Waag Society is the Amsterdam Smart Citizens Lab. In this lab, we explore the tools and applications that make it possible to map the world around us. For example, when can take a swim in the canals, what is the "healthiest" route to your work, and what is the noise level in your residential area? In recent years, various open hardware tools have been made available and online data platforms have been developed that allow citizens to measure their environment and take action. By collectively measuring the environment, people get more insight into the effects of their lifestyle on the ecosystem which can inspire them to be more sustainable. Take a look at the other [Smart Citizens][3] project, Waag Society is involved in.
