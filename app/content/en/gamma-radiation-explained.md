title: What is Gamma radiaiton?
---

Gamma radiation (Î³ radiation) is an invisible electromagnetic radiation with higher energy than ultraviolet light and x-ray.

Gamma rays, just as light and radio waves, are a form of electromagnetic radiation. They therefore consist of vibrating electric and magnetic fields. The difference between all these types of electromagnetic radiation is in the frequency of these vibrations, or in the energy or wavelength that are coupled to the frequency.

The energy of gamma rays is so large that when they pass through a material, chemical bonds can break and electrons can be detached from atoms. It is also said that gamma radiation is 'ionizing'. This can be both useful and dangerous.

If the human body is exposed to excessive amount of gamma radiation, then chemical bonds in the molecules of our cells will break down, causing the living tissues to be damaged. This is obviously dangerous. In places where gamma radiation is produced, for example in nuclear power plants, the necessary protective measures must be taken.

But gamma rays can also kill microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. For example, a doctor may irradiate your infections with gamma rays to destroy the infection. Gamma radiation is also used to disinfect medical devices such as injection needles. Sometimes fruits and vegetables are also irradiated to kill unwanted microorganisms, as a method of preserving.
